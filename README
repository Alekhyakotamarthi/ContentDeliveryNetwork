Design decisions:1) DNS Server:	We did a lot of research on the DNS Query and Response packet. DNS Query contains header in the first 12 bytes and a question that follows containing a question name. Answer specifies the IP of the requested domain.2) HTTP Server	This was pretty straight forward. We used HTTPServer library in python and when client requests for a file, we look for it in our cache first. If it is not present, we would connect to the origin and download it from there and update our cache. We used a naive implementation of LFU cache for caching using dictionaries. We have considered the maximum size of the file and the cache will be cleared by popping the least frequently used entry.3) Best replica - Performance:In order to get the best replica server we have tried many techniques.a) We started off by downloading the database but soon realized that it consumes most of the disk space and is time taking.b) We moved to active measurements and used scamper to get the rtf values. But we realized that the server can be down and the ping right fail. c) So we used geoIP location too to consider the above case.Challenges faced:1) Packing and Unpacking was the most challenging part as understanding the byte code representation and debugging took time. We used UDPServer and BaseHTTPHandler provided by python for our server.2) Selecting the measurement technique for retrieving best replica was the most challenging part as well.Future work to improve performance:While retrieving the rtt values we have tried to implement a technique where the replica server which has responded fast can be considered but it failed because we didnâ€™t have ample time to implement the logic of handling rest of the threads that keep running background.References:GEO IP:1) http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php2) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331627/good-geolocation-api-by-ip3) http://www.geoipview.com/4) http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ACTIVE MEASUREMENT:5) https://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/papers/PKDGU-IGDU-11.pdf6) https://www.net.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/papers/PKDGU-IGDU-11.pdf7) https://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/scamper/8) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27149772/get-first-word-of-string-with-sed9)http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18502945/how-to-execute-a-remote-command-over-ssh-with-argumentsSOCKET:10) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34252273/what-is-the-difference-between-socket-send-and-socket-sendallPRIVATE IP ADDRESS CHECK:11) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/691045/how-do-you-determine-if-an-ip-address-is-private-in-python12) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc333013) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc191814) http://pythoncentral.io/how-to-sort-python-dictionaries-by-key-or-value/MULTITHREADING:15) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846653/how-to-use-threading-in-pythonDNS SERVER:16) https://www.scribd.com/document/192476660/DNS
